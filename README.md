ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Symon Jasmin, the guy who's been tinkering with nuts, bolts, and spreadsheets for a while. I've got a bit of a mechanical mind, you know â€“ I can tell you the torque specs for tightening a bolt faster than you can say "data." But hold on to your hard hats, because I'm about to dive into the realm of data science. Yep, you heard that right, I'm trading my trusty wrench for a keyboard and some pixels.
  

 Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm tossing my measuring tape out the window. Oh no, my mechanical heart still beats true! But now, alongside my collection of screwdrivers, I'm amassing a toolkit of Python scripts and SQL queries. It's like I'm building a Frankenstein's monster of skills, stitching together the best of both worlds.

  So, whether it's calculating the precise number of coffee cups needed for an all-nighter or analyzing datasets to find correlations that make even the most stubborn of gears jealous, I'm your man. From nuts to data points, I'm rewriting the script of my career. Who knows, one day you might just find me in a lab coat, surrounded by data graphs and wearing a hard hat for old-time's sake. Let the mechanical estimator turned data enthusiast revolution begin!
